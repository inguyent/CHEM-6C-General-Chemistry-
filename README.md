# CHEM-6C-General-Chemistry-
Quarter taken: Spring '21

ChEM 6C is the last course of the lower division general chemistry series offered at UCSD.
Amongst coursework was a capstone project to round together the overall teaching of the general chemistry series.
For the Spring 2021 Quarter, the assigned capstone course was a research essay where students were expected to conduct a literature search on contemporary advances made in chemistry towards a more sustainable society.
I chose to base my project around the use of electroreduction for water treatment. Attached are files of the literature search conducted and the final research essay.
